## AIR License and Service Agreement

### Preamble
This License and Service Agreement (LSA) applies to all works and their derivative works based on [source form version] and [object form version] of AIR. Currently, the LSA for AIR has two policies, 'Open Source License' and 'Commercial License'. Therefore, all works including the source code and executable code of AIR and derivative works based thereon are subject to either 'Open Source License' or 'Commercial License' depending on the user's needs and purpose. Details related to the selection of the applicable license are specified in this LSA.
If you use any or all of AIR in any form, you are deemed to have consented to this LSA. If you breach any of the terms and conditions set forth in this LSA, you are solely responsible for any losses or damages incurred by “Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute” (ETRI), and ETRI assume no responsibility for you or any third party.

### Commercial License
If you use the [source form version] or [object form version] of AIR in whole or in part to develop a code or a derivative work, and you want to commercialize the result in some form, you will be covered under a commercial license.
And if you are subject to a commercial license, the contract for the use of AIR is subject to “TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT” of ETRI.
You acknowledge that ETRI has all legal rights, title and interest, including intellectual property rights in the AIR (regardless of whether such intellectual property rights are registered or where such rights exist) and agree with no objection thereto.
Except as provided in a subsidiary agreement, nothing in this LSA grants you the right to use AIR or the name, service mark, logo, domain name and other unique identification marks of ETRI.

### Open Source License
If you use the [source form version] or [object form version] of AIR in whole or in part to develop a code or a derivative work, and you do not commercialize the result in any form, you will be covered under an open source license.
AIR is in accordance with Free Software Foundation (FSF)'s open source policy, and is allowed to use it in the appropriate scope and manner, and you must comply with the applicable open source license policy applied to AIR.
AIR is, in principle, subject to GNU General Public License version 3.0(GPLv3). If you have acquired all or a part of the AIR in any way and it is subject to a license other than the open source license described above, please contact the following address for the technical support and other inquiries before use, and check the usage information.
